### Project Description/ Outline

WHO (World Health Organization) defines the pandemic as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people". COVID-19 has affected every part of the world in 2020, and the purpose of this project reflects in scopes and areas that COVID-19 has impacted (Age, Socio-economic factors related to GDP, locations, Populations, etc.) by analyzing the data of COVID-19 from multiple sets.  

### Research Questions to Answer
  1) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from a global perspective from the population, population density, and GDP
  
  2) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from the US perspective from the population, population density, and GDP 
  
  3) Does the age demonstrate the COVID-19 death risk in the United States?
  
  4) Does GDPs for each state have any relationships with Covid-related deaths?
  
  5) How is gender impacted by Covid-19 deaths in the US?

### Rough Breakdown of Tasks
  1) Gather the data from sets mentioned above
  2) Clean the data into the project scope
  3) Tasks for individuals:
      - Michael Bien: COVID-19 deaths in the World based on the population, density and GDP 
      - Debra Wu: COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. based on the population, density and GDP
      - Jinah Porter: COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. based on the groups of gender and age 
      - Lupita Lopez: Introduction for the project presentation 

### Written Analysis
  1) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from a global perspective from the population, population density, and GDP
  
  2) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from the US perspective from the population, population density, and GDP 
  
  3) Does the age demonstrate the risk level of COVID-19 death in the United States?
    
    Adding more factors to COVID-19 deaths, we wanted to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and the age group, since the media has been raising the concern of COVID-19’s vulnerability risk among people who are older. Based on CDC data, approximately 80% of the COVID-19 deaths are from adults age 65 years and older. In contrast, the age group of children age 14 and under has a significantly low death rate (approx. 0.03%) in the last 7 months of this Pandemic period.   
    
  4) Does GDPs for each state have any relationships with COVID-19 deaths?
  
  5) How is gender impacted by Covid-19 deaths in the US?
  
    Our study in COVID-19 deaths in relation to gender indicates that men face a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than women across the age group from newborns to 84 years. This led to two questions, which are:  1) Is there a similar pattern between COVID-19 deaths in gender and other deaths (i.e., cancer, diabetes, heart diseases, etc.) in gender?, and 2) Why? 
    In order to answer the first question, we pulled another data from CDC; the number of deaths in top 7 causes in the United States by gender. It’s interesting to find out that the male group contains a higher number of deaths for heart diseases, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory disease, stroke and diabetes. 
    As far as answering “why?” -- we were not able to find the direct correlation between the cause and effect; however, we could make an argument based on the CDC statistics that there is a correlation between the percentage of tobacco product use and deaths rate, since there are 25.8% of men in the United States saying yes to tobacco product use, compared to women in 14.1%.
