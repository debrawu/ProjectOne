### Project Description/ Outline

WHO (World Health Organization) defines the pandemic as â€œan epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people". COVID-19 has affected every part of the world in 2020, and the purpose of this project reflects in scopes and areas that COVID-19 has impacted (Age, Socio-economic factors related to GDP, locations, Populations, etc.) by analyzing the data of COVID-19 from multiple sets.  

### Research Questions to Answer
  1) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from a global perspective from the population, population density, and GDP
  
  2) Compare the deaths of COVID-19 from the US perspective from the population, population density, and GDP 
  
  3) Does the age demonstrate the COVID-19 death risk in the United States?
  
  4) Does GDPs for each state have any relationships with Covid-related deaths?
  
  5) How is gender impacted by Covid-19 deaths in the US?
